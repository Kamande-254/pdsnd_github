# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data-Project
Project 2 for Udacity's Nanodegree created on September 10 2023.

## Description
In this project, we will use Python to delve into the world of data and examine the bike-sharing programs in three significant American cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Our goal is to create some code that will enable us to import and analyze this data in order to find interesting patterns by doing some number crunching. In addition, we will create a useful script that enables us to interact with this data directly in the terminal, enhancing the overall educational and engaging experience.

## Files used
* bikeshare.py - final project
* chicago.zip - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
* new_york_city.zip - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
* washington.zip - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)

## Credits
I discovered a useful tool by Ahmed Samy Mekkawy to address the lack of gender and user data in Washington.

An enormous shout-out and appreciation go out to Udacity's outstanding instructors for giving such helpful information during this journey.
